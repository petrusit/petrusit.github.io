<h3>What makes us different</h3>

<p> We will not create software which makes you dependent upon us for
maintenance, further development or support.  Our use of <em>Open
Source</em> technology means that other developers can modify, support
or extend our solutions. We are confident however, that our work will
speak for itself and that our clients will freely choose to come back to
us. </p>

<p> We also believe that trust should be earned, and therefore we
structure our projects to create solid client benefits at each step
along the way.  Clients take one step at a time and keep going only as
long as they feel that they are continuing to get good value for their
investment. We don't ask our clients to bet their entire budget at the
beginning. </p>

<h3>Our basic principles</h3>

    <ul>

        <li>
        The client should always be part of the team.
        </li>

        <li>
        Use solid software engineering practices.
        </li>

        <li>
        Keep up to date with technological advances.
        </li>

        <li>
        Utilize appropriate scientific methods.
        </li>

    </ul>
